## 🚀 Technical Showcases (Live Demos)

### 1️⃣ Zero-to-Data (Cold Start & Sync)
*once you install on another device you find your tasks immediately.*

### 2️⃣ Offline-First & Cloud Propagation
*Split-screen demo: Adding a task in **Offline Mode** (Saved to Sqflite), then enabling internet to see the data automatically propagate to **Firebase Firestore**.*

## 🛠️ Engineering Features

* **Bidirectional Sync Engine:** Uses a `lastSync_$uid` timestamp strategy to fetch only new/updated records (Delta Sync), optimizing bandwidth and battery.
* **Persistent Local Storage:** Powered by **Sqflite** for an "always-available" user experience, even without internet.
* **Real-time Cloud Integration:** Integrated with **Firebase** for multi-device data persistence.
* **Smart Task Management:** * **Time Picker Integration:** Precise task scheduling.
    * **State Persistence:** Completed tasks are dynamically moved to the "Finished Tasks" section.
* **Clean Architecture:** Separation of concerns using **GetX** for state management and the **Repository Pattern** for data handling.

## 📂 Architecture Logic
The app follows a strict **Logic Flow**:
1. **Action:** User adds a task.
2. **Local First:** Task is immediately saved to `Sqflite`.
3. **Sync Check:** The `ConnectivityController` triggers a sync request.
4. **Cloud Push:** Data is pushed to Firebase with a unique User UID key.
5. **Conflict Resolution:** Implemented "Last Write Wins" (LWW) strategy to ensure data integrity.
